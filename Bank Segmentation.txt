About Dataset
Bank Customer Segmentation
Most banks have a large customer base - with different characteristics in terms of age, income, values, lifestyle, and more. Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a customer dataset into specific groups based on shared traits.

According to a report from Ernst & Young, â€œA more granular understanding of consumers is no longer a nice-to-have item, but a strategic and competitive imperative for banking providers. Customer understanding should be a living, breathing part of everyday business, with insights underpinning the full range of banking operations.
